FREECLUPGALLERY_ROOTFOLDER="Address image"
FREECLUPGALLERY_ROOTFOLDER_DESC_15="Select the starting folder for all your image galleries.

FREECLUPGALLERY_TQ_DESC="Adjust the quality (in %) of the generated image thumbnail. Values range from 0 to 100, with 100 giving the best possible result. Values between 70 to 90 should generally be preferred. Remember that the lower this value is, the smaller the size of the generated thumbnail will be and the less processing power it will consume from the server."
FREECLUPGALLERY_TR="Smart thumbnail resize based on above dimensions"
FREECLUPGALLERY_TR_DESC="If set to 'disabled', image thumbnails are displayed based on the aspect ratio of the original image. If set to 'enabled', images are resized to fit the thumbnail viewport as set on the dimension options above. The last option is ideal when you want to display images of different aspect ratio in thumbnails of the same dimensions."

To instantly refresh the thumbnail cache for a particular gallery, simply set this value to 0, reload the gallery page in Joomla! and reset it to 120. Never forget this value to 0 or else thumbnails will be created every time a gallery is loaded, thus overloading the server's resources."
